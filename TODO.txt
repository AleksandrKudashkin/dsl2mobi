Here's a list of things I'd like to be implemented/fixed sooner or later:

1. DSL with multiple headwords cannot be converted.

For example, if there is a card in DSL file with two headwords,
the converter will refuse to deal with it.

headword1
headword2
  The body of the card.

The workaround currently is to compile the DSL with Lingvo Compiler,
and then to decompile it back. The compiler will expand the card into two:

headword1
  The body of the card.

headword2
  The body of the card.

2. DSL Subentries are not properly handled at all at the moment.

Subentries in DSL cards start with @ sign. See Lingvo Help on DSL Subentries
for more info.

Typically, thera not that many dictionaries with subentries, but still.

3. Maybe, the converter should be able to read and proccess the DSL not
only in UTF-8 format, but in UTF-16 format. UTF-16 is the default format
for the DSL dictionaries, and Lingvo (de-)compiler understands only UTF-16.

Implementing this would reduce user's actions during conversion, there
will be no need to perform manual conversion.
